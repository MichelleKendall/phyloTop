# phyloTop
Calculating topological properties of phylogenies

The package ‘phyloTop’ was removed from the CRAN repository and archived on 29/10/2015 as it was no longer maintained by its creator, Michael Boyd.

I am reviving the package and speeding up some of the computations.

# Updates

07/02/2016: version 2.0.0. Some functions removed, renamed or changed, so that the package is not entirely backwards compatible. The remaining functions accept both phylo and phylo4 objects, and are documented. The functions nConfig, ladderSizes and getDepths (on which most of the others depend) have been freshly implemented by Caroline Colijn and are significantly faster.

16/12/2015: approximately half of the functions checked and documented. Package not yet stable.
