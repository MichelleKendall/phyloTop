\title{Colless number}
\usage{
fColless(treeImbalance)
}
\arguments{
\item{treeImbalance}{a tree imbalance matrix as output by \code{treeImb}}
}
\value{
An integer giving the Colless number the tree.
}
\description{
I think: finds the Colless number, given a tree imbalance as input.
Issues: does not match function "colless", so maybe I'm wrong.
Should it have an option to normalize, like "colless"?
Notes: needs to issue warning about input types.
Adapt for phylo as well as phylo4?
}
